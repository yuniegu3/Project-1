Project: Munder Difflin Website


Created a simple single page website for the non-exisiting paper company "Munder Difflin". The purpose of this project was to practice HTML,CSS and JS that I have learned in class. The design was made to be simple to fit the image of the company. 


Credits to all those who gave me pointers!
